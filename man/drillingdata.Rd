\description{
This dataset captures comprehensive information from water point drilling projects conducted between 2018 and 2024.
It includes detailed technical, operational, safety, environmental, and administrative data collected during the site preparation,
drilling, and post-drilling phases.
}
\details{
This dataset is instrumental for analyzing trends in borehole productivity, contractor performance, geological conditions, and environmental
compliance across multiple districts and years. It serves as a foundation for improving decision-making, resource allocation, and the sustainability
of rural water supply systems.
